<h2>Features üìç</h2>

* `Alignment:` boids steer in the average direction of their neighbors
* `Cohesion:` boids steer toward the average position of their neighbors
* `Separation:` boids steer away from neighbors that get too close
* `Wind:` boids can be steered by gusts of wind
* `Predators:` predator boids track prey boids, who run away
* Spatial hashing scheme for efficient rendering
* Interactive GUI for users to adjust simulation parameters
* Immersive background (skybox) with different themes to choose from
* Custom 3D assets (models, textures, etc.) created from scratch in Blender
